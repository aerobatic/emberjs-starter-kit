# Ember Starter Kit

This repo provides a solid starting point for building your own Ember single page app on the [Aerobatic HTML5 platform](http://www.aerobatic.io). This boilerplate provides a solid foundation for building your own app. It comes preconfigured with a number of Grunt tasks including the [grunt-aerobatic](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-aerobatic) task used to power the Aerobatic development workflow.

## Running Tests
`grunt test`

You can see the emberjs-starter-kit app live at http://emberjs-starter-kit.aerobaticapp.com.

## Create App
To create your own app from this template, simply run:

`yoke create-app --github 'aerobatic/ember-starter --github-branch 'grunt'`
